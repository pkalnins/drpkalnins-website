Through teaching, research, and clinical practice, my mission is to offer the highest level of care to individuals seeking integrative, systems-based approaches to health and healing.

I come from a long line of physicians—my father was a surgeon and my grandfather a rural doctor trained in Latvia before WWII. From a young age, I was drawn to the art and science of healing, spending hours in my father’s study and running experiments in a makeshift basement lab.

While studying mathematics, physics, and biology in college, I became increasingly disillusioned with the reductionist view of life that dominates modern science. I felt that living systems couldn’t be fully understood by the same laws that govern inanimate matter. This search for a deeper, more dynamic model of biology eventually led me to study Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine—fields grounded in the principles of interconnectedness, self-regulation, and resilience.

In 1998, I earned my doctorate in naturopathic medicine (ND) and a master’s in Oriental medicine (MSOM) from the National University of Natural Medicine. During my training, I studied Qi Gong and meditation in China, and observed expert herbalists and acupuncturists in Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals. After residency, I practiced integrative primary care before returning to NUNM to teach physiology, biochemistry, herbal pharmacology, and endocrinology for over 17 years.

Along the way, I pursued additional training in clinical research, biostatistics, and data science. I mentored students conducting research on botanical therapies and participated in global health work, including field studies of East African herbal medicine in Tanzania.

Most recently, I completed an NIH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics and computational biology. My research applied machine learning, wearable sensors, and multimodal data to model chronic conditions like metabolic syndrome and liver disease. I’m especially interested in how systems biology and network physiology—fields that view the body as a dynamic, interconnected whole—can inform a new era of personalized, integrative care.

My work is also deeply shaped by the philosophical insights of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and the natural scientific approach of the poet-polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). Their view of life as rhythmic, relational, and irreducibly whole continues to inform my thinking today—whether in the clinic, classroom, or lab.
