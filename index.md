## Welcome

I‚Äôm a licensed naturopathic physician, medical educator, and researcher based in Portland, Oregon. I‚Äôve been in practice since 1998.

I provide Telehealth consultations for clients seeking complementary and integrative solutions for their health concerns, with a special focus on:

- üß† Nervous system health
- üåø Hormone and endocrine balance
- üõ°Ô∏è Immune support
- ‚öôÔ∏è Organ-level systems coherence

My approach integrates traditional medical insights with the latest systems biology, using data, research, and a network-informed lens to support long-term resilience.
