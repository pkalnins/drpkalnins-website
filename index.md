## Welcome

I’m a licensed naturopathic physician, medical educator, and researcher based in Portland, Oregon. I’ve been in practice since 1998.

I provide Telehealth consultations for clients seeking complementary and integrative solutions for their health concerns, with a special focus on:

- 🧠 Nervous system health
- 🌿 Hormone and endocrine balance
- 🛡️ Immune support
- ⚙️ Organ-level systems coherence

My approach integrates traditional medical insights with the latest systems biology, using data, research, and a network-informed lens to support long-term resilience.
